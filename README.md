# JMLR2017
This folder contains material of the following published paper:

"On the Stability of Feature Selection.". Nogueira, Sechidis and Brown.
Journal of Machine Learning Reasearch (JMLR). 2017.

More specifically, the Python folder includes:
- a Python package called stability (given as a .zip file called "stability.zip"). 
  The package includes all tools of the paper, including the functions to compute:
      - stability estimates
      - the variance of the estimates
      - confidence intervals for the population stability
      - A hypothesis test allowing to compare the population stabilities of two feature selection procedures
      - A hypothesis test to check whether a population stability is greater than a given threshold
- a demo in HTML (called stabilityDemo.html) showing how to use this package and providing illustratating its use on real-data scenarios.

The Matlab folder includes:
- All the tools given in the python stability package
- The code of the experiments in Section 7.1 of the paper 

The R folder includes:
- All the tools given in the python stability package
- The code of the experiments in Section 7.2 of the paper
